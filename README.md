# Associate Engineer Tech Test

You may refactor the existing code in `server.js` as a starting point for the tech test if you wish, which is a Node.js/Express application. It has one route already defined which can be accessed by visiting `http://localhost:3000/` the route has been created using [Express](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html). 

If you decide to use this example code, you will need to refactor it to satisfy the tasks for the tech test. Feel free to add/remove/keep any of the npm packages, and redesign the application as you feel fit for your solution.

NOTE: The code uses Node.JS and NPM, so you should have the latest stable versions of these on your machine to run the application. 

To run the code from the terminal, at the root of this repository run:
```sh
npm install # to npm install dependencies such as Express
node server.js # visit http://localhost:3000
```

An acceptable solution would be one that runs locally, allowing us to call an endpoint to retrieve the required list of restaurant data.
